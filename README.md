![Example Dashboard](./swarm.gif)

Swarm Dashboard shows you all the tasks running on a Docker Swarm organized
by service and node. It provides a space-efficient visualization
and works well at a glance. You can use it as a simple live dashboard of the state of your Swarm.

It also shows the CPU/Memory/Disk usage of your swarm node and containers.

## Usage

The dashboard needs to be deployed on one of the swarm managers.
You can configure it with the following Docker compose file:

```yml
# compose.yml
version: "3"

services:
  swarm-dashboard:
    image: mohsenasm/swarm-dashboard:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      TZ: "your_timezone"
      ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION: "false"
      ENABLE_HTTPS: "false"
      NODE_EXPORTER_SERVICE_NAME_REGEX: "node-exporter"
      CADVISOR_SERVICE_NAME_REGEX: "cadvisor"
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager
  
  node-exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:v1.6.1
    volumes:
      - '/:/host:ro'
    command:
      - '--path.rootfs=/host'
    deploy:
      mode: global

  cadvisor:
    image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor:v0.47.2
    volumes:
      - /:/rootfs:ro
      - /var/run:/var/run:rw
      - /sys:/sys:ro
      - /var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro
      - /dev/disk/:/dev/disk:ro
    deploy:
      mode: global
```

and deploy with

```
$ docker stack deploy -c compose.yml sd
```

Note that the usage of `node-exporter` and `cadvisor` are optional, to fetch node CPU/Memory/Disk usage and containers' CPU/Memory usage respectively. If you don't specify `NODE_EXPORTER_SERVICE_NAME_REGEX` and `CADVISOR_SERVICE_NAME_REGEX` envs, the default is not using this feature, because of backward compatibility.

## Security

+ We redact docker event data before sending them to the client. The previous version was sending the whole docker event data, including environment variables (someone might have stored some passwords in them, by mistake!). So, please consider using the newer version.

+ Using the `ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION` environment variable, there is an option to use `Basic Auth`. The WebSocket server will close the connection if it does not receive a valid authentication token. See the example in the above section for more info.

+ Using the `ENABLE_HTTPS` environment variable, there is an option to use `HTTPS` and `WSS`. We have Let’s Encrypt integration with the DNS challenge. See the example in the above section for more info.


## Production use

There are two considerations for any serious deployment of the dashboard:

1. Security - the dashboard node.js server has access to the docker daemon unix socket
   and runs on the manager, which makes it a significant attack surface (i.e. compromising
   the dashboard's node server would give an attacker full control of the swarm)
2. The interaction with docker API is a fairly rough implementation and
   is not very optimized. The server polls the API every 1000 ms, publishing the
   response data to all open WebSockets if it changed since last time. There
   is probably a better way to look for changes in the Swarm that could be used
   in the future.


## Rough roadmap

* Show more service details (published port, image name, and version)
* Node / Service / Task details panel

Both feature requests and pull requests are welcome. If you want to build/test the code locally, see [commands.md](./test-cluster/commands.md) in the `test-cluster` directory.

### Prior art

* Heavily inspired by [Docker Swarm Visualiser](https://github.com/dockersamples/docker-swarm-visualizer)
